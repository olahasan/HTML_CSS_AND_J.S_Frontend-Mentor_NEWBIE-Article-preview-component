## Overview

### The challenge

Practice your layout skills with this article preview component. There's lots of fun to be had playing around with animations for the sharing icons as well.

Your users should be able to:

- See the social media share links when they click the share icon
- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
